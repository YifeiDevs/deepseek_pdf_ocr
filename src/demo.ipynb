Previously, this was attributed to the surface of the filler providing nucleation sites for C-S-H, as there is a clear dependence on the surface provided by the filler particles. Our results reveal that the increase in nucleation is quite low compared to the area provided. Based on the isothermal calorimetry experiments and SEM images, we demonstrate that the most important parameter is the interparticle distance. We propose that this is mainly the result of the shearing conditions rather than extra surface available for C-S-H, as formerly assumed. Quantitatively, slag and fly ash behave very similarly to quartz. Limestone, on the other hand, seems also to stimulate C-S-H nucleation, giving it a higher efficiency in accelerating clinker hydration.\\n\\n<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[196, 407, 309, 420]]<|/det|>\\n## I. Introduction\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[47, 426, 457, 605]]<|/det|>\\nINCREASINGLY, cements contain supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) to replace part of the ground clinker. In addition to the eventual reaction of these phases, they have an impact on the hydration of the clinker component due to their physical presence—this is usually referred to as the filler effect. $^{1,2}$ This effect is most important in the first day or so of hydration, when the microstructure is rapidly developing. The hydrates, mainly calcium silicate hydrate, C-S-H, form connections between the cement grains, leading to setting and strength development. At this early age, the SCM are not yet reacting. The replacement level of SCM and its fineness have been shown to be the major factors affecting the hydration kinetics. $^{3,4}$ Based on these observations, several mechanisms have been reported to explain the filler effect. $^{5\\\\text{–}7}$\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[47, 605, 456, 669]]<|/det|>\\nThe first mechanism is related to the dilution of cement. The replacement of ground clinker by other materials means that relatively more space is available for the formation of hydrates from the clinker hydration. $^{5,6}$ The cement is therefore diluted compared to plain clinker cement paste.\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[46, 669, 457, 836], [487, 198, 899, 338]]<|/det|>\\nThe second mechanism suggested is the heterogeneous nucleation of C-S-H on the filler surface $^{1,4,8,9}$ as there is a clear dependence on the surface provided by the SCM particles. The increase of nucleation sites would be expected to enhance the hydration rate $^{10}$ as C-S-H formation is assumed to be the rate-controlling process during this period. $^{11,12}$ Some microscopical observations have confirmed the growth of C-S-H on SCM surfaces. Stark et al. $^{13}$ observed the nucleation directly on quartz, calcite, and $C_{3}S$ surfaces. The surfaces of the hydrated $C_{3}S$, quartz, and calcite had different coverings of C-S-H. This emphasizes that the chemical nature of the surface can affect the efficiency for C-S-H nucleation. However, there was no quantification of the filler effect reported. Most studies have been limited to qualitative comparison of different types of SCM or inert filler. $^{4,14,15}$ The use of inert particles to understand the basic filler effect is essential. Kadri et al. $^{4}$ focused on different inert fillers. They reported that quartzite had no accelerating effect compared to alumina powder and limestone. However, the replacement level of the fillers in the blended systems was 10%, which is rather low to appreciate the accelerating effect. Poppe $^{15}$ observed that limestone affected the hydration kinetics more than quartz. Although both studies show differences in the efficiency of filler, no explanations were developed.\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[487, 338, 899, 414]]<|/det|>\\nFrom the perspective of producing more sustainable cements, the use of increasing amounts of supplementary cementitious materials is by far the most practical option. Progress in quantification and understanding of the mechanisms behind the filler effect is therefore important to support the use of cements containing SCMs.\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[487, 414, 900, 531]]<|/det|>\\nThis paper investigates the mechanisms underlying the filler effect of four different materials (quartz, slag, fly ash, and limestone) in combination with plain portland cement. Isothermal calorimetry was used to follow the kinetics of hydration and quantify the filler effect during the acceleration period. These results are complemented with microscopy observations to identify the development of the C-S-H on surfaces and obtain new insights on the mechanisms controlling nucleation and growth.\\n\\n<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[600, 547, 789, 561]]<|/det|>\\n## II.

A plain portland cement (CEM I 52.5; Holcim, Holderbank, Switzerland) was mixed with different sized quartz powders ($d_{50}=4$, 13, and 18 $\\\\mu$m). The replacement level of the quartz was from 10% to 70%, and the water/solids ratio was constant at 0.4. The mix design of the experiments are summarized in Table I. $^{29}$ $^{29}$Si NMR measurements proved that there was negligible reaction of the quartz even after 28 days (below 5%). $^{16}$\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[487, 694, 899, 758]]<|/det|>\\nThere is debate as to whether it is best to consider water-to-solids ratio by weight or volume. Even though there is some difference in density between clinker (3.1 g/cm$^{3}$) and quartz (2.65 g/cm$^{3}$), the differences in water-to-solids ratio by volume are relatively small and are taken into account in the analysis.\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[488, 758, 899, 809]]<|/det|>\\n(B) Effect of the Water/Solids Ratio in Cement Paste: Pastes with only portland cement were used with different water/cement ratio from 0.35 to 0.6 to complement the water/solid study.\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[488, 808, 899, 885]]<|/det|>\\n(C) Study With Common SCMs: Common SCM such as fly ash, slag, and limestone were also used as substitutes in the blends. The level of substitution was from 20% to 70% in the slag pastes and 40% and 70% for fly ash pastes. Two slags and one fly ash were used.

Bachofen AG, Switzerland) to obtain a homogeneous blend. About 80 grams of this anhydrous blend were mixed with deionized water (except when mentioned) at the desired water/solids ratio (0.4 for the blends and varying from 0.35 to 0.6 for pure cement). The pastes were mixed at 1600 rpm for 2 min. To study the effect of the mixing speed, some samples were also mixed at a higher speed (15,000 rpm). A mortar sample of the plain cement was prepared with standard sand according to EN-197-1 at a water/solids ratio of 0.5.\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[535, 852, 946, 969]]<|/det|>\\n(B) Isothermal Calorimetry: The hydration was followed by calorimetry (TAM Air, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE). Ten grams of paste were placed in the calorimeter. The instrument was maintained in a temperature-controlled room to ensure the stability of the baseline.

The slope of the linear part of the acceleration was used to characterize the kinetics of the different systems.'},\n",

The pore solution was extracted using a steel die device and pressure up to 35 MPa (studies were only made up to a few hours). The liquid obtained was filtered using a 0.2 $\\\\mu$m filter. About 3.3 mL was diluted in a solution with $HNO_{3}$ acid to prevent precipitation. The calcium concentration was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan).\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[94, 700, 506, 970]]<|/det|>\\n(D) Microstructural Observations of the Surfaces: The morphology of the hydration products was studied with a FEI XL-30 SFEG-SEM (FEI, Hillsboro, OR). The hydration of the pastes was stopped by solvent exchange with isopropanol. At the required times, 0.2 g of the paste was taken out from the sealed sample and put in a filter funnel with two filter papers (retention 5 $\\\\mu$m). The funnel was immediately filled with isopropanol and the sample stirred in the funnel for 2 min. Then the isopropanol was removed with a vacuum pump. The washing was repeated four times. As the paste was quite young and not set at the time of observation (less than 10 h of hydration), the paste collapsed to a powder. Once the isopropanol was removed by evaporation, the dried powder made of hydrated grains was collected from the filter paper and stored under vacuum in a desiccator for 5 days. SEM specimens were prepared from the dried powder. It was dispersed on an adhesive carbon tab and coated with a carbon layer of 15 nm. A minimum of ten grains in each paste have been observed in different locations on the SEM specimen to be representative of the bulk of the sample. The microscope parameters are shown on the micrographs.\\n\\n![](C:\\\\Users\\\\Ivey\\\\Desktop\\\\ocr\\\\1\\\\output\\\\page-4\\\\images\\\\4.jpg)\\n\\n\\n\\n<|ref|>figure_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[536, 532, 946, 557]]<|/det|>\\nFig. 8.

The replacement level of quartz ranged from 20% to 70%. Although quartz is inert, the rate of reaction of the clinker component is enhanced. The main peak is higher and the acceleration slope steeper. The aluminate reaction, characterized by the shoulder on the deceleration, is also enhanced by the replacement with quartz. This effect will not be discussed further here as this reaction is still under investigation. In the past, similar effects in slag blends have been observed and attributed to the slag reaction; $^{17,18}$ the results here show that this is not related to any reactivity of the SCM but is purely a consequence of the physical replacement (i.e., the so-called “filler effect”).\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[535, 789, 947, 942]]<|/det|>\\nThe study is focused on the acceleration period of the main peak, which can be described by its slope. Figure 3 shows the slope value as a function of the replacement level for three different finesses of quartz powder. For each quartz size, a relationship of increasing acceleration slope with replacement level is observed. The increase is dependent on the replacement and the size of the quartz powder. For the quartz having a similar specific surface area to cement (i.e., the solid surface is nearly constant for different replacement levels), the slope only slightly increases with the replacement.

This effect is usually regarded as the increase of the surface available for the nucleation of C-S-H $^{1,5,19}$, as the rate of formation of C-S-H is assumed to be the rate-determining process during the acceleration period. $^{11,12,19,20}$\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[486, 128, 896, 307]]<|/det|>\\nHowever, more detailed analysis of this relation shows that the impact of the extra quartz surface is quite low compared to the surface of the clinker grains. When the total surface is increased from $1\\\\,\\\\mathrm{m}^2/\\\\mathrm{g}$ (that of the plain cement) to $2\\\\,\\\\mathrm{m}^2/\\\\mathrm{g}$, the slope value only increases by about 20%. In comparison, for different finenesses of plain cement it is seen that the acceleration slope for plain cement increases in direct proportion to the surface; $^{21,22}$ data from the experimental work of Costoya $^{22}$ on alite shows in Fig. 4 that a doubling of the surface leads to a doubling of the slope. If the only effect of the quartz was to provide extra nucleation sites, the efficiency of the quartz surface is only about one-fifth that of the cement grains and we would expect to observe less C-S-H on quartz grains compared to cement grains.\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[486, 306, 896, 372]]<|/det|>\\nHowever, this is in contradiction with our microscopical observations.

Figures 5(a) and (b) show the surface of the quartz and cement after 5 min of hydration. Small particles can be seen on both surfaces. A few of these can be identified as ettringite (hexagonal rods) or calcium hydroxide (hexagonal plates). However, most of the particles seem to be blobs thought to be C-S-H nuclei. The presence of nuclei on the quartz surface indicates that ionic species are available everywhere in the solution and confirms that the quartz surface acts as a substrate for the heterogeneous nucleation of the hydrates. By 2 h, more ettringite crystals and some of the C-S-H nuclei have started to grow with needlelike morphology [Figs. 5(c) and (d)]. After hydration for 5 h [Figs. 5(e) and (f)] the C-S-H is well-defined as needles which diverge in a “sea anemone” type morphology. The growth on the quartz is similar to that on the cement grains.\\n\\n<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[97, 852, 408, 865]]<|/det|>\\n## (2) Effect of the Distance Between Particles\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[96, 865, 504, 916]]<|/det|>\\nWhen filler with smaller size than cement is used to replace cement, the surface-to-surface distance which separates the particles (cement and filler particles) is reduced as illustrated in Fig. 6.\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[96, 916, 505, 969]]<|/det|>\\nIn cement paste the distance between particles is also affected by the water/cement ratio. $^{23}$ Figure 7 shows the effect of increasing water/solids ratio on the kinetics of hydration.

Alkalis are known to affect the kinetics of hydration and when the w/c ratio increases, the concentrations of the dissolved ionic species (e.g., alkalis) are expected to decrease. Nevertheless, experiments with cement paste adjusted (w/c 0.6) with additional alkali show no effect on the hydration kinetics (see Fig. 7).

For a similar water/solid ratio, fine particles will have smaller interparticle distances (Fig. 6).

The first observation is that all the systems (blended systems and plain cement systems), including variations in water-to-cement ratio, fall on the same curve. The smaller the distance, the higher the acceleration rate, and this effect is independent of the nature of the particles: both quartz–cement and plain cement systems follow the same relation. This indicates that the acceleration rate is related to the space between particles. The quartz having similar particle size to cement leads to an almost constant distance between the particles for different replacement. For this system, the slope only slightly increases due to the increase of the level of substitution. This effect was previously pointed out in Fig. 3.\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[45, 700, 455, 866]]<|/det|>\\nSeveral interpretations of the relation between distance and acceleration rate are possible, which may be related to either chemical or mechanical effects. For example, a smaller interparticle distance will mean a shorter path for the diffusion of chemical species. This might improve the supply of the species and favor the nucleation and growth of the hydrates (i.e., higher acceleration rate). Nevertheless, the diffusion of the species in the pore solution is fast $^{27}$ and so is unlikely to be rate limiting. Furthermore, the distribution of C-S-H is quite homogeneous on the surface of all the particles. If diffusion was critical, we would expect that quartz surfaces close to the cement grains have more nuclei and faster growth, which is not observed.\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[64, 866, 336, 879]]<|/det|>\\nMechanical reasons seem more plausible.\\n\\n<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[47, 904, 238, 917]]<|/det|>\\n## (3) Effect of the Shearing\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[46, 917, 455, 969], [485, 394, 895, 497]]<|/det|>\\nFigure 9 shows the impact of increasing the shearing conditions. When cement is mixed as a mortar, the coarse sand particles increase the shearing condition during the mix. The total surface available for nucleation does not change much, as the sand is too coarse to make a significant difference in the relative surface for heterogeneous nucleation. $^{6}$ However, it can be seen in Fig. 9 that the acceleration rate is significantly enhanced compared to cement paste. In fact, the increase in slope going from a paste to a mortar is as much as produced by the introduction of the quartz filler. This suggests that the shearing conditions in the mortar are similar to those in the quartz–cement paste.\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[485, 497, 895, 650]]<|/det|>\\nMicroscopic observations shown in Fig. 10 reveal that in mortar the number of growth sites is increased. Figure 10(a) shows the surface of a cement grain in cement paste at 4 h of hydration. C-S-H forms bushes distributed on the smooth surface at regular distances from each other. Ettringite crystals are also visible. In the mortar [see Fig. 10(b)], the cement surface shows similar hydrates, mainly C-S-H and ettringite. However, here the surface is covered by many nuclei and individual needles everywhere. This indicates that increasing shearing generates more nucleation sites on the cement surface. This effect was also suggested by Juilland $^{28}$ to explain the denser microstructure in paste mixed in high shearing conditions.\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[485, 649, 896, 792]]<|/det|>\\nThe cement surface in the quartz–cement paste Fig. 10(c) is seen to have a similar microstructure to the cement mortar Fig. 10(b): many nuclei (C-S-H needles and ettringite crystals) are distributed everywhere on the surface. This suggests that the introduction of quartz also increases shearing, which can result from the reduction of the space between particles. Kinetics results and microstructural observations are in good agreement. Mortar and quartz–cement paste have a similar number of growing sites and comparable acceleration slopes. This illustrates well the relation between the nucleation density of C-S-H and the kinetics of the acceleration period.\\n\\n<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[487, 814, 690, 827]]<|/det|>\\n## (4) Shear Rate Calculation\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[485, 827, 895, 866]]<|/det|>\\nTo explore the relationship between the distance between the particle and the shearing conditions, we can estimate the shear rate induced between the particles.\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[485, 866, 896, 969]]<|/det|>\\nIn the case of simple shear [Fig. 11(a)] two planes are parallel; one is moving, the other is fixed. A gradient of velocity which defines a shear rate is applied in the distance which separates the two planes. In the case of paste, the planes are the grains of cement or quartz. The distance between the surfaces of the particles is $\\\\delta$ rather than H (the distance between particle centers). The same shear rate is thus applied to a reduced distance, which is the gap.'},\n",

Figure 13 shows the kinetics of the hydration of the pastes with 40% substitution of plain cement by one of the two slags (slag 1) and one fly ash in turn compared to the substitution of quartz at the same level. All the curves are very similar to the quartz–cement curve for the first 24 h.

Compared to quartz–cement paste, the acceleration is higher and also the induction period is shortened. The points relating to the limestone systems shown in Fig. 14 (slope against normalized shear) make it very clear that limestone powders have an additional effect beyond the effect of increasing shear produced by the other fillers. The micrographs in Fig. 16 also clearly show that limestone has a different effect on the nucleation of C-S-H compared to the other SCMs. After 5 min the limestone [Fig. 16(c)] and cement surfaces are similar [Fig. 16(b)]. After 90 min, which corresponds to the end of the induction period (Fig. 15), the limestone surface is completely covered with nuclei [Fig. 16(c)]. This was not observed for quartz or the other SCMs. At this stage, in the same sample, the cement grains have only a few dispersed nuclei. This microstructural observation indicates that C-S-H nucleate preferentially on the limestone surface. Figure 16(e) shows a limestone grain after 5 h. C-S-H needles are growing densely perpendicular to the surface while the C-S-H on the cement grains shows the same divergent sea anemone morphology seen previously. The length of the C-S-H needles on both the cement and limestone surface seems similar.\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[46, 928, 457, 968]]<|/det|>\\nThese observations are complemented by TEM images of a limestone–C$_3$S paste from Amelie Bazzoni. $^{30}$ Unlike SEM micrographs, TEM images display the cross section of the\\n\\n<|ref|>figure_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[515, 51, 877, 78]]<|/det|>\\nTable V.

Figure 17 shows the grains of C$_3$S and limestone at the time where the maximum heat flow is reached ($\\\\sim$10 h). The different morphology of the C-S-H is clearly identified: individual needles perpendicular to the surface on limestone grains and different orientation of growth on C$_3$S grains. However, the length of the C-S-H needles is the same on both C$_3$S and limestone grains (about 300 nm). Therefore, it appears that limestone favors the nucleation of C-S-H while the growth rate on limestone and C$_3$S is similar. The observations in this limestone–C$_3$S system also rule out any role of aluminate in the higher nucleation on the limestone surface.\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[486, 649, 898, 804]]<|/det|>\\nThere may be several explanations for the increased nucleation on the limestone surface. There is a slight dissolution of limestone as indicated by a higher concentration of calcium in solution at the end of the induction period (Table V). This increase in calcium is likely to be the explanation for the shorter induction period seen in Fig. 15. However, it is also possible that the arrangement of the calcium atoms on the calcite surface provides a “templating” effect which facilitates the nucleation of C-S-H. This explanation is supported by the micrograph in Fig. 18 of C-S-H on limestone in the limestone–C$_3$S system which seems to show alignment of the C-S-H along certain (crystallographic?) directions.\\n\\n<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[585, 821, 800, 834]]<|/det|>\\n## IV.

Microscopical observations show the nucleation density is very similar across cement and quartz surfaces even though the quartz surfaces only enhance the acceleration slope by 20% compared to the cement surfaces.\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[95, 128, 504, 243]]<|/det|>\\nRather, our results show a clear relation between the interparticle distance and the kinetics of the acceleration period. This can be explained by the shearing between particles which increases as the interparticle distance decreases. This explanation is supported by observations on mortars, where shear is increased by the presence of large sand grains, but the surface provided for nucleation is almost unchanged. Furthermore, increasing the shear rate by changing the mixing speed has quantitatively the same effect on acceleration.\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[95, 243, 504, 396]]<|/det|>\\nThere are several possible explanations as to why higher shear produces more nuclei. High shear may disturb the double layer surrounding the cement grains when they are dissolving, moving ions from this gradient of concentration and better dispersing them through the mix. Recent experiments $^{3}$ have indicated that when the mixing speed is too low, there is an accumulation of ionic species close to the $C_{3}S$ grains which decreases the dissolution rate. Consequently, fewer ions are found in the solution at low mixing speed. It is also possible that subcritical C-S-H nuclei forming during the mixing time can be dislodged and displaced onto the surface and the pore space, as suggested by Juilland et al. $^{28}$.\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[95, 395, 504, 510]]<|/det|>\\nThe study of limestone indicates that additional factors operate here to give a much higher density of C-S-H nuclei on limestone surfaces. Consequently, limestone has a larger accelerating effect on the hydration due to the high number of nuclei while the growth rate of individual needles on limestone is not changed. The increased nucleation on limestone surfaces may be related to the dissolution of this phase, but also to a favorable surface structure, providing a “template” for C-S-H precipitation.\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[95, 510, 504, 562]]<|/det|>\\nThis study gives new perspectives for the design of the blended systems. New reasons are provided to explain the effect of fillers. The role of limestone and its potential benefits in cement hydration have been clarified.\\n\\n<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[243, 580, 358, 593]]<|/det|>\\n## Acknowledgments\\n\\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[95, 601, 504, 644]]<|/det|>\\nThe authors would like to thank A.
